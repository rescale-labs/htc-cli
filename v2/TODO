# Soon

* CRUD and view for all limits
* Tests!
* CRUD for tasks and (modulo delete) projects
* Run a job
* Check job status
* Get job logs
* Print env vars expected in usage.
* Check for RESCALE_API_KEY when getting/updating token and return
  UsageError when empty.
* Universal OS X binaries: [GitHub - randall77/makefat: A tool for making fat OSX binaries (a portable lipo)](https://github.com/randall77/makefat)
* merge in upload/download from htccli
* scope out htcctl functionality to implement here
